## Science Communication

I'm also a passionate science communicator and outreach enthusiast. When I’m not peering at the Universe I spend my time talking about it through radio, writing and award-winning public talks!

<!-- I’m happy to respond to media requests for interviews and expertise on astronomy or physics related topics, as well as matters of science funding and culture. -->
