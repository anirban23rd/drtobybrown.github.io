I am also a passionate science communicator and outreach enthusiast. When I’m not peering at the Universe I spend my time talking about it through radio, writing and award winning public talks!

I’m happy to respond to media requests for interviews and expertise on astronomy or physics related topics, as well as matters of science funding and culture.
