## Astrophysics

<i>How do galaxies evolve?</i> is the question at the heart of my research. In search of answers, I examine the reservoirs of gas (chiefly atomic hydrogen) in galaxies to understand how both internal and external processes combine to regulate star formation and the build-up of stellar mass. My specialism lies in the simultaneous analysis of large, multi-wavelength datasets in order to say something about the galaxy population as a whole. 

To complete this work, much of my time is spent developing and optimising bespoke software for handling, visualising and analysing big data.
